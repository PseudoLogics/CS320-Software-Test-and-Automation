## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through standardized coding practices and secure programming. Utilizing encapsulation and private fields in a proper way and making sure that only necessary information is updateable and exposed. Also having a rigorous and standardized CI/CD pipeline with checks for vulnerabilities and dependencies, coupled with regular review of reports and outputs. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By following the outline described in the user stories, software development documentation, and developing a thorough understanding of the business and use-cases. All of these factors contribute to building a well rounded understanding of the user's needs and their intentions with a program.

## How do I approach designing software?
My approach is a combination of more traditional waterfall methods combined with modern agile methodology. I like to plan and flowchart up front and to design the tests ahead of time to help design the best software and testing strategy. Then I like to flowchart and wireframe. After this I like to develop and test on the fly and make any changes necessary in an agile way. Capped with rigorous testing at the end.
